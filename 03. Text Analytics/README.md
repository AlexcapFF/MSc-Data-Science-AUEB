*This folder contains 2/4 assignments for the Text Analytics course* <br><br>
**Note:** The projects were a group effort. <br><br>
For more info (data, requirements) you can check the team's repo in gitlab:<br>

### Scope of Assignments
The scope of the assignments presented here was to pick a dataset and perform text analytics methods on it. We decided to use a dataset with tweets from kaggle and perform sentiment analysis on it. 
- Assignment2 <br>
For this assignment we used several different classifiers and chose the best performing. 
- Assignment3 <br>
For this we created Multi Layer Perceptrons (Keras) and selected the best performing Neural Network. 
- Assignment1 and Assignment4 (**in gitlab only**)<br>
The other two assignments which can be found in our gitlab repo were about N-gram Language Models (Assingment1) and building a Recurring Neural Network on the tweeter dataset (Assignment4).



### Data Origin
The dataset was downloaded from kaggle.
