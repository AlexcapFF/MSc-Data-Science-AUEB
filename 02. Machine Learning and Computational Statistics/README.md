# Machine Learning and Computational Statistics (2nd Trimester)
*This folder contains the final assignment for the Machine Learning course.*

### Information
The scope of this course was to present various parametric and non-parametric ML techninques for Supervised and Unsupervised Learning. <br>Some of the algorithms/methods we covered were:
- Linear and Logistic Regression (classification)
- LASSO & Ridge Regressions (l-norm regularization)
- ML, MAP, Bayesian Inference and EM
- Parzen Windows
- k-Nearest Neighbors
- SVM (both linear and non-linear)
- k-means
- Neural Networks (MLPs, RNN, CNN)
- Gradient Descend and Backpropagation
- Decision trees and clustering
- Validation Techniques (cross-validation, train-test split etc.)
- Performance criteria (accuracy, precision, recall, f1, etc.)

### Project Info
The project's scope was spectral unmixing and pixel classification.
