# MSc. Data Science

### Introduction
This repository contains all the assignments I completed for the **MSc. in Data Science** offered by the **Athens University of Economics and Business** in the time period 2018-2020.<br>
<br> All assignments have been evaluated and graded before they were uploaded.<br>

I consider this repository as my portfolio since it serves the purpose of showing my progress throught the program's duration as well as a demonstration of the skills I had and those I acquired.
