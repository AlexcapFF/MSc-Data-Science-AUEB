# Practical Data Science (1st Trimester)
*This folder contains the 2 assignments for the Practical Data Science course.*<br><br>
This course served as an introduction to data science methods and its main goal was to familiarize us with Python and Jupyter Notebook. 
<br>


### Data Origin
- The data for the Chicago Crime Analysis were downloaded from: https://data.cityofchicago.org/Public-Safety/Crimes-2001-to-present/ijzp-q8t2/data <br>
- The data for the Energy Consumption Analysis were downloaded from: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Appliances+energy+prediction
