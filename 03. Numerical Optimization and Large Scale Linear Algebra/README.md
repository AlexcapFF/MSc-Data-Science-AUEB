# Numerical Optimization and Large Scale Linear Algebra (3rd Trimester)
*This branch holds the three assingments for the NOaLSLA course*

The scope of this course was to expose us to numerical optimization methods.

### Assignments
- 1st Assignment: <br>
    The scope of this assignment was to create two Gaussian Elimination algorithms with partial and complete pivoting. They were then used to matrices of different size and ill-conditioned matrices.
- 2nd Assignment: <br>
    The scope of this assignment was to deblur an image with large matrix-dimensions using SVD and the theory behind it.
- 3rd Assignment: <br>
    The scope of this assignment was to create Google's pagerank algorithm using the Power Iteration and Gauss-Seidel iterative method. 


**Note**: *Obviously, partial or total copying of these assignments should include their source*
